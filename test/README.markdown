 _A Pen created at CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/dustyyeti/pen/abbqOwg](https://codepen.io/dustyyeti/pen/abbqOwg).

 A few simple lines of Javascript to get the values of parameters from a URL, and fill them into a form field(?event=Event Name). It also decodes URI's to have clean inputs (i.e. no '%20').
